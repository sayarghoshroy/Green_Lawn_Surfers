#### Description

- You are Yellow Bird Chuck

- Angry Bird Red is the police officer chasing you down with his police dog.

- Collect Coins by jumping

- Reach the end to win

- The fly boost keeps you safe from obstacles but you cannot collect coins.

- Jump Boots let you jump higher

- Shield superpower lets you break through obstacles.

- Running into a stationary lava bonfire or charging firebox will result in instant death

- The three things you should avoid:

	1. Bricks: You can jump over these only with jump boots

	2. Barricades: Try crouching

	3. Missiles: Difficult to jump over

	- If you touch these when the policeman is close, you are caught

	- Else, you slow down, and the policeman gets a chance to catch up with you
